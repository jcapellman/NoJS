# NoJS
MVC Core Library to optimize views for legacy or low-end systems/devices

There are 2 supported paths in NoJS at present<br/>
1. User Agent detection of older machines/browsers to redirect to a *.t.cshtml<br/>
2. Autostriping of javascript, css and other newer web ui tools

Focusing on path #2 right now with a HTML 5/CSS 3 -> HTML 1.0/pre-css conversion
